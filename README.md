Please review the attached document, [Draw It or Lose It Business Requirements and Plans](https://github.com/JessicaDuft/Draw_It_Or_Lose_It/blob/main/Draw%20It%20Or%20Lose%20It%20Business%20Requirements%20and%20Plan.docx) , to view the business plan I created for The Gaming Room's desired web based game application. This business plan was created in CS230 Operating Platforms at Southern New Hampshire University. This document demonstrates my ability to approach a project with client needs and requirements priortized and my ability to effectively communicate with stakeholders. 






# Draw_It_Or_Lose_It
<br/>
The client, The Gaming Room, created a web-based game application that they wanted to expand across multiple operating systems. 
<br/>
I was able to reccomend an operating platform for the company to use to expand theig game. I was also able to advise on development aspects such as memory and storage management, 
#security,architecture, and networking. 
<br/>
Personally, learning to create and read a UML diagram was extremely helpful for me. I'm a visual learner and it really helped me break down the requirements set forth by the company.
<br/>
<br/>If I were to go back and revise one area, I would revise the development tools area. I could expand more on development tools that are available to developers for each operating system.
<br/>
Using the UML chart allowed me to interpret the client's needs from the very beginning. Breaking down the requirements and mapping them in a very visual way allowed me to consistently have something
to look back on to be sure that I was considering all of the client's requirements as I proposed reccomendations. Meeting the client's requirements is a top priority.<br/>
The client has a particular vision with particular needs. In order to satisfy the client and ensure that their vision for the application they are paying to create, it is imperative to meet all requirements. <br/>
<br/>I approcahed designing this software by first analyxing the client's vision and requirements. I then mapped the requirements out and considered them in each step to ensure
that the client's needs were fully met. 

#I approached desiging this customer by analyzing and researching multiple operating systems that would allow the user to meet their needs. I then analyzed each opearting system
#deeply and reccomended one that would best meet the client's needs as well after weighing out the advantages and disadvantages of each system. All documented for the client to review
#and make an informed decision with.
